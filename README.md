# COLOR FLIPPER USING VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

## Why I made this project?
To be honest, it was simply just to become more familiar with Javascript. It is
not my first language so learning the syntax is not that hard. At least for now. It is
actually my first ever Javascript project. I made this without any familiarity
with Javascript and little experience with HTML and CSS.

## Why Color Flipper?
I was actually just trying to learn some Javascript without following a tutorial
and made a super duper simple project. So I googled project to learn Javascript.
I've come acrossed this project suggestion in FreeCodeCamp (just the suggestion not the code) and I thought
"Hey, let's build that. it seems simple". But I don't want to waste time figuring out the UI stuff, so
I just went with ugly UI and I just want to focus on the Javascript.

## Why is it only single file? Why don't you organize it?
Like I said I just want to focus on the Javascript side, I know how to organize it, like maybe make a separate JS
file or CSS file but hey its a single page website and does not require any other pages that references to the same JS.
So it's not going to slow anything down. Plus, I just want to play around and see if I can make it work and it does
